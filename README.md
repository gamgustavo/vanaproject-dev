# sam-vana-app

This project contains source code and supporting files for a serverless application that you can deploy with the SAM CLI. It includes the following files and folders.

- github/workflows/main.yml - The file contain the setup for github actions pipeline
- sam_vana/api_publico - Code for the application's Lambda function provided by Vana
- events/event.json - Invocation events that you can use to invoke the function.
- tests/unit - Unit tests for the application code.
- tests/integration - Integration tests for the application code.
- template.yaml - A template that defines the application's AWS resources, using SAM framework
- samconfig.toml - Configuration file to SAM Framework, setup to config deploy project

## Requirements

- Github account and repository
- AWS account with IAM access key generated and permissions to create resources
- AWS CLI Installed in your environment
- AWS SAM installed in your environment
- AWS CLI logged in environment
- Setup github secrets for: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

## Devops Pipeline

![Pipeline](/img/vana-pipeline.png "Pipeline")

## Deploy the application

To build and deploy the application for the first time, run the following in your shell:

```bash
sam build
sam deploy
```

The first command will build the source of the application. The second command will package and deploy the your application to AWS, please review the file samconfig.toml to setup your aws environment.

You can find your API Gateway Endpoint URL in the output values displayed after deployment.

## Use the SAM CLI to build and test locally

Build your application with the `sam build --use-container` command.

```bash
$ sam build --use-container
```

The SAM CLI installs dependencies defined in `sam_vana/requirements.txt`, creates a deployment package, and saves it in the `.aws-sam/build` folder.

Test a single function by invoking it directly with a test event.

Run functions locally and invoke them with the `sam local invoke` command.

```bash
sam-app$ sam local invoke SamVanaFunction --event events/event.json
```

## Fetch, tail, and filter Lambda function logs

To simplify troubleshooting, SAM CLI has a command called `sam logs`. `sam logs` lets you fetch logs generated by your deployed Lambda function from the command line.

You can find more information and examples about filtering Lambda function logs in the [SAM CLI Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-logging.html).

## Tests

Tests are defined in the `tests` folder in this project. Use PIP to install the test dependencies and run tests.

```bash
$ pip install -r tests/requirements.txt --user
# unit test
$ python -m pytest tests/unit -v
# integration test, requiring deploying the stack first.
# Create the env variable AWS_SAM_STACK_NAME with the name of the stack we are testing
$ AWS_SAM_STACK_NAME="sam-app" python -m pytest tests/integration -v
```

## Cleanup

To delete the sample application that you created, use the AWS CLI.

```bash
sam delete
```
